The museums in Britain, large and small, let people recognize and understand what art and design are, and at the same time, let people realize that human art plays an irreplaceable role in life. This week, the teacher led us to visit The Design Museum, the world's first museum with design as its theme, and its exterior architecture is very modernistic. Everyone can enjoy art and design and feel excited for the resonance of the soul.

There are many surrealist works in the exhibition hall that impressed me deeply, surrealism is an artistic and literary movement that emerged in the early 1920s, characterized by its exploration of the subconscious mind and the use of dream-like imagery, unexpected juxtapositions, and other unconventional techniques. It is considered to be a continuation of the Dada movement, which had preceded it and also challenged traditional artistic and cultural norms.
