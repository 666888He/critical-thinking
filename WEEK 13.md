The museums in Britain, large and small, let people recognize and understand what art and design are, and at the same time, let people realize that human art plays an irreplaceable role in life. This week, the teacher led us to visit The Design Museum, the world's first museum with design as its theme, and its exterior architecture is very modernistic. Everyone can enjoy art and design and feel excited for the resonance of the soul.
